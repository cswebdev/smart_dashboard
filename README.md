# Analytics Dashboard

This is a static front-end project for an analytics dashboard built with React JS. It is designed to showcase my skills and serve as a proof of concept.

The data being used for the user directory, invoice directory, and data chart directory come from mockdata. 
The data on the dashboard is mostly static and hard coded.
